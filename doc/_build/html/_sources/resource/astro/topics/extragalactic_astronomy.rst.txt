Extragalactic Astrophysics
==========================

-  **Just started**

HST Surveys and Large Projects
------------------------------

-  `3D-HST - A Spectroscopic Galaxy Evolution Survey with the Hubble
   Space Telescope <https://3dhst.research.yale.edu/Home.html>`__

   -  3D-HST surveyed ~600 square arcminutes of well-studied
      extragalactic survey fields (AEGIS, COSMOS, GOODS-S, UKIDSS-UDS)
      with two orbits of primary WFC3/G141 grism coverage and two to
      four orbits with ACS/G800L coverage. The short acquisition images,
      taken in the WFC3/F140W and ACS/F814W filters used for wavelength
      reference for the spectra, are also deeper than most ground-based
      observations.

Ground-base Specoscopic Surveys
-------------------------------

-  `List of spectroscopic surveys by Ivan
   Baldry <http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/~ikb/research/galaxy-redshift-surveys.html>`__

   -  Covers all the “classic” ones, but some links might no longer work
      any more.

-  `PRIMUS: PRIsm MUlti-object Survey <https://primus.ucsd.edu>`__

   -  A spectroscopic survey to z=1 with ~120,000 robust galaxy
      redshifts covering >9 sq. deg. of the sky, focusing on regions
      with deep Spitzer, optical, GALEX and X-ray data. `Data release
      available <https://primus.ucsd.edu/version1.html>`__

-  `Lega-C: Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics
   Census <http://www.mpia.de/home/legac/>`__

   field <http://cesam.lam.fr/zCosmos/>`__

   -  VIMOS survey of 28,000 galaxies at 0.2 < z < 1.2 and 12,000
      galaxies at 1.2 < z < 3. `Data release
      available <http://cesam.lam.fr/zCosmos/search/download>`__
   -  Due to the special role of the COSMOS field for spec-z and photo-z
      calibration, this dataset is also very important.

-  `VUDS: VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey <https://cesam.lam.fr/vuds/DR1/>`__

   -  VIMOS survey of ~10.000 very faint galaxies to study the major
      phase of galaxy assembly 2 < z ≲ 6. `Data release
      available <https://cesam.lam.fr/vuds/DR1/>`__

-  `MOSDEF: The MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field
   Survey <http://mosdef.astro.berkeley.edu>`__

   -  Charting the evolution of the rest-frame optical spectra for ~1500
      galaxies in three distinct redshift intervals spanning 1.4 < z <
      3.8 in AEGIS, COSMOS, and GOODS-N.

-  `ZFIRE: A Keck/MOSFIRE SPECTROSCOPIC SURVEY OF STAR-FORMING GALAXIES
   IN RICH ENVIORNMENTS DURING
   COSMIC-NOON <http://zfire.swinburne.edu.au/index.html>`__

   -  A KMOS study of the gas kinematics and metallicity in 77 SFGs with
      a median redshift of z ≃ 3.5, probing a representative section of
      the galaxy main-sequence.

-  `KCS: KMOS Cluster
   Survey <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/arXiv:1708.00454>`__

   -  A 30-night KMOS GTO program performing deep absorption-line
      spectroscopy in four main overdensities at 1.39 < z < 1.8 and one
      lower-priority overdensity at z = 1.04 to bridge our high-redshift
      observations with the local sample.

Groud-base Imaging Surveys
--------------------------

-  `Deep Hyper Suprime-Cam Images and a Forced Photometry Catalog in
   W-CDF-S <https://zenodo.org/record/2225161#.XBnQji2ZOV5>`__

      dense gas across the entire molecular disks of 9 nearby
      star-forming galaxies.
   -  EMPIRE provides, for the first time, resolved (1-2kpc resolution)
      maps of a suite of density-sensitive transitions in the 3mm
      atmospheric window, including HCN (1-0), HCO+ (1-0) and HNC (1-0).

   -  We provide predictions for galaxy populations over a wide range of
      rest UV luminosity from MUV ∼ −6 to ∼ −24 between z = 4 – 10.
