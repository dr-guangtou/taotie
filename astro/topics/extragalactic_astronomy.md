* **Just started**

## HST Surveys and Large Projects

* [3D-HST - A Spectroscopic Galaxy Evolution Survey with the Hubble Space Telescope](https://3dhst.research.yale.edu/Home.html)
  - 3D-HST surveyed ~600 square arcminutes of well-studied extragalactic survey fields (AEGIS, COSMOS, GOODS-S, UKIDSS-UDS) with two orbits of primary WFC3/G141 grism coverage and two to four orbits with ACS/G800L coverage. The short acquisition images, taken in the WFC3/F140W and ACS/F814W filters used for wavelength reference for the spectra, are also deeper than most ground-based observations.

## Ground-base Specoscopic Surveys
