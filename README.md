# Tao Tie (饕餮) - A collection of resources for astrophysical research

* “The taotie is a motif commonly found on Chinese ritual bronze vessels from the Shang and Zhou dynasty” - Wikipedia

* Over the last few years, I have tried to collect useful resources for astrophysical research in several different ways.  Now, it seems a GitHub repo is the best solution. I will gradually transfer my notes and bookmarks here. This place is still heavily under construction. I will create a series of notes first, and I am thinking about what is the best way to organize them later. 

* Please let me know if you have any suggestion or recommendation.
