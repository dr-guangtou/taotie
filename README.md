# Tao Tie (饕餮) - A curated collection of resources for astrophysical research

<img src="doc/taotie_logo.png" width="80%">

----

* “The taotie is a motif commonly found on Chinese ritual bronze vessels from the Shang and Zhou dynasty” - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taotie)

* Over the last few years, I have tried to collect useful resources for astrophysical research in several different ways.  Now, it seems a GitHub repo is the best solution. I will gradually transfer my notes and bookmarks here. This place is still heavily under construction. I will create a series of notes first, and I am thinking about what is the best way to organize them later. 

* Please let me know if you have any suggestion or recommendation.

## [Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and AI related](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/tree/master/mlearning)

* Since machine learning is becoming more and more important in astrophysics and cosmology, I am giving it an independent directory now.

- [Basics of machine learning](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/mlearning/machine_learning_basic.md)
    * Online books, courses, handbooks...right now there are too many of them, so this might not be your best choice. 

## [Resources for a Specific Topic in Astrophysics or Cosmology](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/tree/master/topics)

* There is no way this is even close to a complete list.  It only reflects the interests of the author.  Contributions are welcomed, and will try to organize it better.

- [Basic tools for cosmology research](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/topics/cosmology_tools.md)
    * CMB, 2PCF, and dark matter halos. All the fancy words you need in cosmology.

- [List of important extragalactic surveys and data](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/topics/extragalactic_projects_and_data.md)
    * This could be a really...really long list, and should be organized better. 

- [Photometry of galaxies and stars](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/topics/photometry.md)
    * The most fundamental and the most difficult task of astrophysical observations.

- [Stellar physics and stellar population synthesis](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/topics/stellar_and_spops.md)
    * Isochrone, stellar libraries, and stellar population models.

- [Stars in the Milky Way](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/topics/milky_way.md)
    * Galactic dynamic and chemical evolution. _Gaia_ and LAMOST. 

- [What about ISM and Dust?](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/topics/ism_and_dust.md)
    * And all the other inappropriate questions in astrophysics.

## [Readling List of Interesting Astrophysical Topics](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/tree/master/reference)

* Again, right now this is just a personal list of interesting topics.
* Now, it includes reading list on [galaxy cluster cosmology](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/reference/cluster_cosmology.md), [halo splashback radius](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/reference/halo_splashback_radius.md), [intrinsic alignment of galaxies](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie/blob/master/reference/wl_intrinsic_alignment.md)
